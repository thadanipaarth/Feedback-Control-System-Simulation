# Feedback-Control-System-Simulation

Implemented pole-placement and linear quadratic regulator on the following systems:
- Cart pendulum
- Complex pulley
- Mass spring system 
- Simple pendulum 
- Simple pulley 

In all of the above systems output of pole placement, LQR and behaviour of system without an external input was comapred. 

### Pakages used (GNU Octave)
- control

### Steps To Run

> The feedback mechanisms can be changed in the main function, there are three options in each syatem:
> - No external input 
> - LQR (Liner quadratic regulator)
> - Pole placement
